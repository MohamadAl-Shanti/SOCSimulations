This applies to a very simple and specific form of serverless application (S3 hosted front end, and API-Gateway communicating with backend)

1. If using and monitoring AWS API-Gateway, configure a new IAM policy to allow CloudFront to collect logs from the API-gateway. 
   An account must be configured with "iam:CreatePolicy" to configure IAM policies. See related AWS user account provisioning documentation.
2. Configure API-Gateway for CloudWatch log collection.
3. Configure S3 bucket for CloudWatch collection: Create separate log bucket. Will be used for forwarding to Splunk.
4. Download Splunk Addon for AWS from Splunk Enterprise.
5. Configure new IAM role for Splunk log forwarding ex/ splunk-soc-service (read-only).
6. Very upsettingly complicated process of configuring aws cloudwatch and s3log inputs on Splunk Enterprise.
